    "### Introduction\n",
    "Publicly listed companies in the U.S. are required by law to file \"10-K\" and \"10-Q\" reports with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) (SEC). These reports provide both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the company's performance, from revenue numbers to qualitative risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When companies file 10-Ks and 10-Qs, they are required to disclose certain pieces of information. For example, companies are required to report information about [\"significant pending lawsuits or other legal proceedings\"](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersreada10khtm.html). As such, 10-Ks and 10-Qs often hold valuable insights into a company's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights, however, can be difficult to access. The average 10-K was [42,000 words long](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-109-894-word-annual-report-1433203762) in 2013; put in perspective, that's roughly one-fifth of the length of Moby-Dick. Beyond the sheer length, dense language and lots of boilerplate can further obfuscate true meaning for many investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news? We might not need to read companies' 10-Ks and 10-Qs from cover-to-cover in order derive value from the information they contain. Specifically, Lauren Cohen, Christopher Malloy and Quoc Nguyen argue in their [recent paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1658471) that we can simply analyze textual changes in 10-Ks and 10-Qs to predict companies' future stock returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this investigation, we attempt to replicate their results on Quantopian.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For an overview of this paper from Lauren Cohen himself, see [the Lazy Prices interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g96gROyc3wE) from QuantCon 2018.)"

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Companies make major textual changes to their 10-Ks and 10-Qs when major things happen to their business. Thus, we expect that textual changes to 10-Ks and 10-Qs are a signal of future stock price movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the vast majority (86%) of textual changes have negative sentiment, we generally expect that major textual changes signal a decrease in stock price (Cohen et al. 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we expect to find alpha by shorting companies with large textual changes in their 10-Ks and 10-Qs."

    "### Methodology\n",
    "1. Scrape every publicly traded company's 10-Ks and 10-Qs from the [SEC EDGAR database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Remove extraneous content from the 10-Ks and 10-Qs (numerical tables, HTML tags, XBRL tags, etc).\n",
    "2. For each company, compute [cosine similarity](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/metrics.html#cosine-similarity) and [Jaccard similarity](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#jaccard-similarity-score) scores over the sequence of its 10-Ks and 10-Qs. Each 10-K is compared to the previous year's 10-K; each 10-Q is compared to the 10-Q from the same quarter of the previous year.\n",
    "3. Compile these scores into one dataset.\n",
    "4. Upload the data to Quantopian using [Self-Serve Data](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/upload-your-custom-datasets-and-signals-with-self-serve-data), then use [Alphalens](http://quantopian.github.io/alphalens/) to analyze the performance of 10-K and 10-Q text changes as an alpha factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers steps 1-3. For step 4, see the [Alphalens study](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/analyzing-alpha-in-10-ks-and-10-qs) notebook."
